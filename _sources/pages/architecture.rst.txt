Technical Architecture
======================
Hatchet is a cloud-first application, which means a fairly substantive SDLC /
platform overhead is baked into even the simplest app. This section outlines
the architecture of our application and the external tools that are used to
orchestrate the operation of the application.

A big shout out to the following third-party applications for supporting this
open-source project (and many, many more):

* GitHub
* Travis CI
* Coveralls
* Amazon AWS and Elastic Beanstalk
