Hatchet is a web application for centralizing college football data from 
a variety of sources, managing the "golden-source" of that data, and providing 
it in a usable form for analysis. The data can be accessed in the following 
ways:

* Hatchet Web API: Flask-hosted, see our Swagger docs
* Web Application: Angular app for exploratory analysis of the data
* Python client: Simple python abstraction of the web API
